# Sample Position-Based Dynamics (PBD) Implementation in C++

This C++ project showcases a basic implementation of Position-Based Dynamics (PBD). Explore the simulation of particle dynamics and interactions using PBD principles. Experiment with various parameters, observe constraint effects, and gain hands-on experience in simulating complex physical behaviors. This project offers an entry point into understanding Position-Based Dynamics through practical implementation.
